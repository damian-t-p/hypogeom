# hypogeom

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`hypogeom` implements the basic distribution functions for the hypogeometric distribution, which is the sum of independent geometric distributions.
It is the discrete analogue of the hypoexponential distribution.

## Installation

You can install the development version of from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("damian-t-p/hypogeom")
```

## Example

This package contains functions that are typically associated with probability distributions in R.
That is, the probability mass function, distribution function, quantile function, and random generator.

```{r example}
library(hypogeom)

# The hypogeometric distribution is parameterised by a vector of success probabilites,
# which are the parameters of the constituent geometric distributions
probs <- c(0.2, 0.5, 0.01)

dgeom(c(0, 1, 2, 10), probs)
```

```{r}
pgeom(c(-1, 2, 5.5), probs)
```

```{r}
qgeom(c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95), probs)
```

```{r}
rgeom(10, probs)
```
